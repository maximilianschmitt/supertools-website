# App logs

When your app isn't behaving as expected, it's important to have easy access to its logs. Luckily, logs on Supertools are always just one click away.

Click "View logs" under "More" in the right-hand sidebar to view an app's logs.

A new tab will open with the raw output of your app's stdout and stderr.
