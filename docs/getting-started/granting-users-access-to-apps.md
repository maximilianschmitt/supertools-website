# Granting users access to apps

Before you can enable your app for others, you need to add some users to your Supertools instance.

## 1. Create users

Go to "Settings" and then "Users and roles". Click the "Create new user" button.

Create 3 users: Alina, Alex and Ania.

**Good to know:** In the "Users and roles" settings you can manage all your users in one place. You can edit their information, grant / revoke access to / from apps and change their roles. For this tutorial we won't be making further changes here.

## 2. Grant users access

Head back to "Apps" and check out the right-hand sidebar of your "Hello world" application.

Tick the checkboxes next to Ania and Alex to grant them access.
